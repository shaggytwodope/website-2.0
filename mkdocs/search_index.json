Description of Modifications.\n\n\nAll Documentation to which You contribute must identify the changes You made to create that Documentation and the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Documentation provided by the Initial Writer and include the name of the Initial Writer in the Documentation or via an electronic link that describes the origin or ownership of the Documentation. The foregoing change documentation may be created by using an electronic program that automatically tracks changes to the Documentation. You must make all such changes and required information publicly available for at least five years following release of the changed Documentation.\n\n\n3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.\n\n\nContributor represents that Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s), Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License, or both of these statements are true.\n\n\n3.5. Required Notices.\n\n\nYou must duplicate the notice in the Appendix in each file of the Documentation. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Documentation file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a reader would be likely to look for such a notice, for example, via a hyperlink in each file of the Documentation that takes the reader to a page that describes the origin and ownership of the Documentation. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in the Appendix.\n\n\nYou must also duplicate this License in any Documentation file (or with a hyperlink in each file of the Documentation) where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights.\n\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Documentation. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Writer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Writer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Writer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n\n3.6.

You may also choose to use such Documentation under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by OpenSolaris. No one other than OpenSolaris has the right to modify the terms of this License. Filling in the name of the Initial Writer, Original Documentation or Contributor in the notice described in the Appendix shall not be deemed to be Modifications of this License.\n\n\n7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE DOCUMENTATION IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.

an \nIllumos\n based Unix-like operating system derived from OpenSolaris.\nThe purpose of the OpenIndiana Project is to ensure the continued availability of an openly developed distribution based on OpenSolaris.\nThe OpenIndiana project is also a continuation of the collaborative effort and community spirit of the \nOpenSolaris project\n.\n\n\nFor a comprehensive history of the OpenSolaris project, see Jim Grisanzio's \nOpenSolaris timeline\n.\n\n\nWhy is it called OpenIndiana?\n\n\nOpenIndiana obtains its name from Project Indiana, an open source effort by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) to produce OpenSolaris, a community developed Unix-like distribution based on Sun Solaris.\nProject Indiana was led by Ian Murdock, founder of the Debian Linux Distribution.\n\n\nHow are OpenIndiana and Illumos related?\n\n\nThe \nIllumos project\n is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports \nillumos-gate\n, the core software used by the OpenIndiana distribution.\nSimilar to a BSD \nsrc\n tree, illumos-gate includes the illumos kernel, along with many of the device drivers, core libraries, and system utilities.\n\n\nTo form a complete distribution, the OpenIndiana project combines illumos-gate with \noi-userland\n, and with other free and open-source software.\nThis melding of software from many different open-source projects is similar to how Linux distributions use the Linux kernel along with software from the GNU and various other open source projects.\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana differ from OpenSolaris?\n\n\nSome of the differences between OpenIndiana and OpenSolaris can be characterized as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSun/Oracle's proprietary OS/NET consolidation has been replaced with \nillumos-gate\n.\n\n\nMany of the original OpenSolaris software consolidations have been reorganized into a single oi-userland consolidation.\n\n\nOracle's Sun Studio has been replaced with the open source GNU GCC compiler.\n\n\nXVM (XEN) has been replaced with the illumos-kvm port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster's transition from Sun Studio to GCC has resulted in a discontinuance of ABI (binary) compatibility with previous releases of OpenIndiana, Oracle Solaris, and OpenSolaris.\nApplications coded in the \nC\n language should continue to work normally.\nTherefore, this change only affects applications written in the \nC++\n language.\n\n\n\nHow does OpenIndiana compare to BSD or Linux?\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of these operating systems follow the Unix paradigm and contain tools and commands which bear a similar resemblance, although specific feature sets and command usage may be dissimilar.\nIf you are coming to OpenIndiana from either BSD or Linux, you will quickly learn these differences.\nIn no time at all, you'll feel right at home working with OpenIndiana's tools and commands.\n\n\nWhat features does OpenIndiana have?\n\n\nOpenIndiana contains the following enterprise class features and more:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZFS\n\n\nZFS File System and Volume Manager\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDTrace\n\n\nDynamic Tracing Framework - (System

\nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not yet support USB 3.0.\n\n\n\n\nWhen attaching backward compatible USB 3.0 devices to your system, please ensure they are \nNOT\n attached to a USB 3.0 port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAt this time, creating a bootable flash drive requires the use of a header file.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 unique USB header files (1G and 2G).\n\n\nPlease ensure you have selected the correct file.\n\n\nThe 1G.header is only suitable for use with the text installer (Command line console).\n\n\nThe 2G.header is only suitable for use with the live installer (Gnome desktop).\n\n\nThe files are \nNOT\n interchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to use the correct USB header file can result in the USB drive either failing to boot, or only partially booting (and falling back to systems maintenance mode with KSH93 errors).\n\n\n\nFor further information about how to create a bootable OpenIndiana flash drive, consult the \nOpenIndiana Handbook\n.\n\n\nWhat package manager does OpenIndiana use?\n\n\nOpenIndiana uses the network based \nImage Packaging System (IPS)\n.\nFor those coming to OpenIndiana from BSD or Linux, the IPS package manager will be an easy transition.\nYou may also continue to use the legacy \npkgadd/pkgrm\n commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe OpenIndiana distribution provides a basic set of packages, along with some extras.\nThere are also 3rd party repositories which provide additional packages.\nIf you wish to contribute by helping to expand package availability, please read further down about how to get

project is the open source community which develops, maintains, and supports the \nOpenIndiana\n distribution, an \nillumos\n based Unix-like operating system derived from OpenSolaris.\nThe purpose of the OpenIndiana Project is to ensure the continued availability of an openly developed distribution based on OpenSolaris.\nThe OpenIndiana project is also a continuation of the collaborative effort and community spirit of the \nOpenSolaris project\n.\n\n\nFor a comprehensive history of the OpenSolaris project, see Jim Grisanzio's \nOpenSolaris timeline\n.\n\n\nOpenIndiana Software Releases\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately every six months, the OpenIndiana project releases a snapshot of the Hipster rolling release branch.\nIdeally suited for both workstations and servers, simply choose the installer type which best serves your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkstation\n\n\nServer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive installer (Gnome desktop)\n\n\nText installer (command line console)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana releases from the legacy oi-dev-151x branch are no longer maintained.\nFor those desiring to upgrade from legacy installations, Hipster IPS repositories are available.\nWhile upgrades from the legacy branch are possible, the most trouble free method is to perform a clean install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nHipster is a rapid development branch where software versions are frequently updated.\nWhile every package is tested to ensure stability, caution is nevertheless warranted when deploying Hipster into mission critical production environments.\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nDisk Space\n\n\nMemory (RAM)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n64 Bit\n\n\n20GB (or more)\n\n\n4GB (or

installer\n\n\nDownload the appropriate OpenIndiana 1G or 2G header file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAt this time, creating a bootable flash drive requires the use of a header file.\n\n\n\n\nThere are 2 unique USB header files (1G and 2G).\n\n\nPlease ensure you have selected the correct file.\n\n\nThe 1G.header is only suitable for use with the text installer (Command line console).\n\n\nThe 2G.header is only suitable for use with the live installer (Gnome desktop).\n\n\nThe files are \nNOT\n interchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to use the correct USB header file can result in the USB drive either failing to boot, or only partially booting (and falling back to systems maintenance mode with KSH93 errors).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not yet support USB 3.0.\n\n\n\n\nWhen attaching backward compatible USB 3.0 devices to your system, please ensure they are \nNOT\n attached to a USB 3.0 port.\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Media Creation

hardware.\nWhen using Live Media to explore OpenIndiana, no changes are made to your system, unless you explicitly choose to install OpenIndiana.\n\n\nAlthough it is possible to use it over a network with SSH X forwarding if you enable SSH.\n\n\nBooting OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place holder for section introduction  content \n\n\nBooting Physical Hardware\n\n\n\n\n\nInsert the bootable media (DVD or USB flash drive) and boot (start/restart) your computer.\nFor the computer to boot from the media, you may need to specify the device by pressing the boot order hotkey.\nAlternately, you may need to change the boot device order in your BIOS configuration.\n\n\nBooting Virtual Hardware\n\n\nThe most efficient way to boot a virtual machine is to boot directly from the DVD ISO file.\nAlternately, you may use host to guest DVD/USB passthrough to boot from physical media.\n\n\nVirtualbox\n\n\nFor VirtualBox 3.2 or later:\n\n\n\"Use host I/O cache\" must be enabled in the emulated storage controller used by the virtual machine to successfully boot OpenIndiana.\n\n\nVmware Workstation Player\n\n\n place holder for content \n\n\nVmware ESXI\n\n\n place holder for content \n\n\nThe OpenIndiana Boot Menu\n\n\nWhen you see a menu, press Enter to start OpenIndiana on your computer.\nAs it runs, you will be prompted with a few questions.\nYou should eventually be presented with a desktop.\n\n\nAuthenticating when using the OpenIndiana LiveDVD\n\n\nThe user login for the text session is username 'jack' along with the password 'jack'.\nFor administrative or elevated access, prepend your commands with \npfexec\n.\nYou may also use the \nsudo\n command.\n\n\nYou may obtain root using the \nsu\n command along with the password 'openindiana'.\n\n\nUsing the Device Driver Utility\n\n\nYou can use the Device Driver Utility to check if your hardware requires additional drivers.\n\n\nPreparing to Install OpenIndiana\n\n\n\n\n\n Place Holder for section introduction

content \n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place Holder for content \n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana from Live Media\n\n\nTo install OpenIndiana from Live Media, you have two options.\n\n\n\n\nGUI based guided install.\n\n\nText based guided install.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these options is represented by a desktop icon.\nSelect the appropriate installer option by clicking the corresponding desktop installer icon.\n\n\nGUI based Guided Install\n\n\n Place Holder for Content \n\n\nText based Guided Install\n\n\nThe text based guided install start and runs within a command line console.\nNavigation within the installer is performed by pressing specifically designated navigation keys (F2, Tab, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe non-graphical text based bootable media installer also uses this very same \nText based Guided Install\n.\n\n\n\nStart the Text based Guided Install by double clicking the Text based Guided Install icon.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you begin the Text based Guided Install, you are presented with the welcome screen.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nThe installer identifies the disks which are available for installation.\nIf you have only a single disk, it is already selected.\nIf you have multiple disks, use the arrow keys to select the appropriate disk.\nWhen finished, press F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nDisregard the minimum and recommended sizes as they do not take into account periodic disk usage growth as the result of ZFS snapshots.\nTo account for this, your disk should be at least 25GB or more.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your disk contains a GPT disk label, the entire disk will be reformatted.\nThis warning serves as your advisory.\nIf this is acceptable, press F2 to continue.\nOtherwise use the arrow keys to select cancel.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you are presented with the choice of how to partition the disk.\nYou may select to use an EFI partition (which uses the entire disk), or you may choose to create MBR partitions.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate choice and press F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nSpecify the computer name you wish to use.\nBy default the computer name is \nopenindiana\n.\n\n\n\n\nThis screen is the same as as the previous.\nWe have illustrated it twice to help clarify the 2 distinct configuration tasks which need to be completed on the screen.\n\n\nAfter configuring the computer name, now you need to decide whether to automatically configure networking (DHCP), or leave network unconfigured.\nUse the arrow keys to select your choice.\nPress the F2 key to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen (and the following 2 screens) you will configure your time zone.\nIf you select UTC/GMT, you will only be presented with this single screen.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate region.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the arrow keys, select your time zone location.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the arrow keys, select the appropriate time zone.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you may configure the date and time.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\nIn this screen you are presented with several different fields to configure.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE\n\n\n\nThe regular user specified on this screen is granted the \nroot\n role.\nIn effect this means by default (and without any further configuration) this user can perform administrative task by assuming the root role as needed.\nAlso, after installation the root password is automatically expired and needs to be changed prior to being used for any administrative task.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have completed the installation configuration, you are presented with an \nInstallation Summary\n.\nIf these configuration settings are correct, begin the installation by pressing the F2 key.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation progress is measured by means of a status bar.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the installation completes you are presented with a summary screen.\nThe installation logs are available by pressing the F4 key.\nIf you ran the installation from Live Media, can exit the installation by pressing F9.\nOtherwise, you will want to reboot the system using the F8 key.\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana using the Text Installer\n\n\nThe text installer is not graphical nor does not have a live environment.\nWhen you boot from the text installer, it immediately begins the installation process using the previously described \nText based Guided Install\n.\n\n\nTroubleshooting Installations\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not see a menu after booting your computer with the DVD or USB device, and instead see some text and a \"grub\n\" prompt, there may be an error in your copy of the installer, or it was created incorrectly.\n\n\nIf you see a \"login:\" prompt after selecting your keyboard and language and no desktop appears after several seconds, there may be a problem with the drivers for your graphics hardware.\n\n\nPlease let us know via IRC or the mailing list if this happens.\n\n\nWhen you contact us, please include any error messages you see on the console, as well as the output of the \nsvcs -xv\n command.\n\n\nIf possible, also include the contents of the file \n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB 3.0 issues\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Hipster does not currently support USB3.\n\n\nYou cannot boot a USB thumbdrive installer from a USB3 port.\n\n\n\n\nUsing OpenIndiana\n\n\n Place holder for section introduction content \n\n\nConfiguring Networking\n\n\n Place holder for section introduction content \n\n\nCommand Line\n\n\nManual

NOTE:  \nDisregard the minimum and recommended sizes as they do not take into account periodic disk usage growth as the result of ZFS snapshots.\nTo account for this, your disk should be at least 25GB or more.   If your disk contains a GPT disk label, the entire disk will be reformatted.\nThis warning serves as your advisory.\nIf this is acceptable, press F2 to continue.\nOtherwise use the arrow keys to select cancel.   In this screen you are presented with the choice of how to partition the disk.\nYou may select to use an EFI partition (which uses the entire disk), or you may choose to create MBR partitions.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate choice and press F2 to continue.   Specify the computer name you wish to use.\nBy default the computer name is  openindiana .   This screen is the same as as the previous.\nWe have illustrated it twice to help clarify the 2 distinct configuration tasks which need to be completed on the screen.  After configuring the computer name, now you need to decide whether to automatically configure networking (DHCP), or leave network unconfigured.\nUse the arrow keys to select your choice.\nPress the F2 key to continue.   In this screen (and the following 2 screens) you will configure your time zone.\nIf you select UTC/GMT, you will only be presented with this single screen.\nUsing the arrow keys select the appropriate region.\nPress F2 to continue.   Using the arrow keys, select your time zone location.\nPress F2 to continue.   Using the arrow keys, select the appropriate time zone.\nPress F2 to continue.   In this screen you may configure the date and time.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.   In this screen you are presented with several different fields to configure.\nUsing the arrow keys navigate between the fields.\nPress F2 to continue.     NOTE  \nThe regular user specified on this screen is granted the  root  role.\nIn effect this means by default (and without any further configuration) this user can perform administrative task by assuming the root role as needed.\nAlso, after installation the root password is automatically expired and needs to be changed prior to being used for any administrative task.   Now that you have completed the installation configuration, you are presented with an  Installation Summary .\nIf these configuration settings are correct, begin the installation by pressing the F2 key.   Installation progress is measured by means of a status bar.   After the installation completes you are presented with a summary screen.\nThe installation logs are available by pressing the F4 key.\nIf you ran the installation from Live Media, can exit the installation by pressing F9.\nOtherwise, you will want to reboot the system using the F8 key.",

fork and fix (just as you would anything else).\n\n\nUse TODO's.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Writing Tips\n\n\n\n\nWrite your docs by asking a question and then answering it.\n\n\nLater turn the questions into sectional headings, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a thesaurus - e.g. \nhttps://www.powerthesaurus.org/\n\n\nCouch read - via a phone or tablet, proof read what you previously wrote. - (puts you into the reader's shoes)\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Asciidoctor?\n\n\nAsciidoc is a text markdown language using a Python based interpreter.\nAsciidoctor is a more modern and more powerful Ruby based implementation of Asciidoc.\nAsciidoctor also includes some of features found in documentation frameworks such as Sphinx (which is used by the Python and PC-BSD projects).\nThe Asciidoctor framework can be used for docs as well as for the production of other types of content (news stories, blog posts, etc.).\n\n\nSystem Characteristics\n\n\n\n\nEasy to use (even easier than Sphinx)\n\n\nTOC is easy to navigate (but not quite as clean as Sphinx)\n\n\nLike Sphinx, produces a very professional looking end product.\n\n\nDoes not yet support chunked html, but can export to docbook and use docbook tools to perform this task.\n\n\nSupports the pulling together of several small documents using the concept of \"includes\".\n\n\nMore flexible than Sphinx in that it can be used as part of a larger web content framework.\n\n\n\n\nAsciidoctor compared to Sphinx\n\n\nBoth systems have their relative merits with advantages and disadvantages.\nFor example if all you want to do is write and publish some docs, then Sphinx is a good choice.\nHowever, if you want to do a little more (like the Jenkins project is doing), then Asciidoctor is likely the better choice.\n\n\nWhy a Text Markup Based Docs Framework?\n\n\nThe primary advantage of using a text markup language is readability and flexibility.\nThe raw code for your content is simply text.\nThis is something you can make sense of without special tools (e.g. Docbook based WYSIWYG XML editors, etc.).\n\n\nTips for Working with Asciidoctor\n\n\n\n\nUse \"Attributes\" and name space them - e.g. \n:uri-project: \nurl\n -(place these attributes at top of document)\n\n\nCall your attributes in your docs like this: \n{uri-project} [Project name]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse \"Includes\" - e.g. \ninclude:: {uri-macros}/doc_to_import.asciidoc[]\n - (allows you to pull in other docs into your docs)\n\n\n\n\nAsciidoctor Tools and Informational Links\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nURL\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/\n\n\nAsciidoc Language (the syntax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://asciidoctor.org/\n\n\nRuby based parser and tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://discuss.asciidoctor.org/\n\n\nAsciidoctor support forum\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.asciibinder.org/index.html\n\n\nAsciibinder -

For the later, static website  baking  frameworks such as  Awestruct  or  Jekyll  along with dynamic  mobile first  CSS frameworks such as  Bootstrap  or  Foundation , the entire OpenIndiana website, and all it's content, can be continuously integrated in a fully automated fashion.",
